# Christmas Tree Web Interface

See http://blog.websages.com/2012/12/03/christmas-with-cron-2007-edition/ for
the primary inspiration around this.

This project is a front-end for X10 automation of my Christmas Tree Lights.
Goals are primarily around allowing anybody on my wi-fi network to control the
tree lights and for me to learn a tiny bit about mobile web design. I am not a
designer, and I make ugly things.  Sorry about that. It could improve, but I
would not hold my breath.

Right now you can view the site from your desktop and click button links or
from a mobile device and use swipe methods for on/off.

This front-end assumes you have X10 configured via something like a
Firecracker, a serial port and a transceiver.
